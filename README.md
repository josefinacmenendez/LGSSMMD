# Linear Gaussian State Space Model capable of handling missing data (LGSSMMD)

This repository contains a set of routines for smoothing gaussian observations using state space modeling. 

## StateSpaceMissing
This statistical model was used in [1] to analyze physiological signals during propofol anesthesia.

To run analyses on a simulated data example, run 'ss_main.m'.
