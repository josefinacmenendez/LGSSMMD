# StateSpaceModels

This repository contains implementations for a linear gaussian state space model capable of handling missing data.

Model parameters are estimated via Expectation Maximization. 

This statistical model was used in Bastos et all, 2021, to analyze physiological signals during propofol anesthesia.
